🎯 Optional Stretch Goals:

⭐ Allow user input (choose country & date range)
⭐ Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash
⭐ Include hospitalization or ICU data if available

✅ Final Deliverable:

A Jupyter Notebook data report that:

Loads, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes COVID-19 data.

Communicates insights with a clear narrative and visuals.

It is easy to read, well-commented, and reproducible.



Key Objectives You May Have Achieved:

✅ Collected global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas
✅ Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and filtering relevant countries
✅ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
✅ Created visualizations (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, optional choropleth maps) to illustrate key metrics
✅ Calculated critical indicators such as death rates and vaccination coverage
✅ Presented insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook report combining code, visuals, and narrative explanations
